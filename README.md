## Some Resources for Learning:

- http://wesbos.com/ - has some awesome courses including a free one JavaScript30. I really like his pacing and the hands-on labs are short and fun.

- JavaScript Novice to Ninja (published by SitePoint) - https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition *** free download and source files for projects
- https://www.theodinproject.com/
